## Installation

Please refer to the [ESPHome documentation](https://esphome.io/guides/getting_started_command_line.html).

You can use `flexispot_ek5.yaml` as a boilerplate for your own implementation. This implementation has been created for the ESP8266 nodemcu, but can easily be adopted for other platforms.
